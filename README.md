# Current state

At this time, the font only consists of:
 - the lowercase alphabet
 - the uppercase alphabet
 - hyphen (-) character. 

# Using the font

An `.otf` and `.ttf` file can be found in the `Build` folder.

# Adjusting the font

This font is completely free and open source, thus feel free to use and change it in any way you would like. I created this font using inkscape and fontforge, and included all source files into this repo.
